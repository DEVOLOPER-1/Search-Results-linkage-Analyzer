# Welcome to the Search Results Linkage Analyzer (S.R.L.A.)! 🎉

Hey there! Welcome to the Search Results Linkage Analyzer (S.R.L.A.) project! This app is your new best friend for diving deep into search results and getting the most relevant insights in a fun and interactive way.

## What Does S.R.L.A. Do? 🤔

Great question! The S.R.L.A. app retrieves search result links and analyzes their relationships, displaying everything in a super cool dashboard. Just type in your query, and watch the magic happen as the app breaks down the results and serves up all the juicy details you need.

## How It Works 🛠️

### 1. Getting Started
- Enter your search query and your Serp API key.
- The app fetches search results for your query using the API key.
- Each result comes with a snippet, giving you a sneak peek of what the page is about.

### 2. Analyzing the Results
- Key statements are extracted from each snippet.
- Using Term Frequency (TF) analysis, the app scores the relevance of each statement.
- Results are ranked and scores adjusted based on their position in the search results.

### 3. Finding the Best Results 🌟
- The app calculates an average relevance score and sets a threshold.
- Only results above this threshold make it to the "highly relevant" list.
- These top results are organized into a "node list."

### 4. Building the Network 🔗
- The app connects all the highly relevant results, creating a network.
- Betweenness centrality is calculated but usually zero due to the network's structure.
- Degree centrality is also calculated, showing how interconnected the results are.

### 5. Discovering Communities 🧩
- The Girvan-Newman algorithm identifies clusters within the relevant results.
- These clusters highlight thematic groupings for deeper insights.

### 6. Visualizing the Data 📊
- A heatmap shows the relevance scores of the results.
- A 3D network graph provides a spatial view of the connections.
- Knowledge graph and images related to your query are also displayed.

### 7. Enhanced Features 🚀
- **Knowledge Graph Scraping:** Extracts detailed data about names, locations, entities, etc.
- **Image Scraping:** Displays the first applicable image related to your query.

## Visualization and Dashboards 🖥️

- The app exports graphs and data as PNG images and JSON files.
- These are imported into a Streamlit dashboard, converting JSON data into visual charts and tables.
- The dashboard is interactive and customizable with light and dark modes.
